Monterey is one of Californiaâ€™s most luxurious and beautiful travel destinations. A visit to the Monterey Bay can be spent relaxing on the beach or whale watching via boat ride, and on the mainland, an assortment of gourmet restaurants and fun, leisurely activities, like the Vista Blue Spa or the Wine Trolley Tours, are a great way to enjoy your vacation.
