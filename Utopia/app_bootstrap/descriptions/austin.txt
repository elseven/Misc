The Texas State Capital is also the Live Music Capital of the world and offers a unique and eccentric view of Texas that some may not know existed. Kayak or paddleboard down Town Lake, take a dip in Barton Springs on a hot day, or visit the wild nightlife on 6th street and catch a concert at the beautiful Moody Theatre.
