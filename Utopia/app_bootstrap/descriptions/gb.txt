Green Bay, Wisconsin, is home to the Cheeseheads, fans of the Green Bay Packers, a NFL team so successful that Green Bay has nicknamed itself "Titletown, USA."  But there is much more to this town than sports, Green Bay has a beautiful Botanical Garden thats open all year long, and the Bay Beach Wildlife Sanctuary consists of 700 acres of trails and animal exhibits. But, no trip to Green Bay would be complete without visiting the famous Lambeau Field.
