This sprawling metropolis is bursting at the seams with culture and energy; take a walk down Haight-Ashbury street and feel like youâ€™ve traveled in time back to the 1960s, or take a ferry ride out into the middle of the bay and visit the infamous Alcatraz prison. Enjoy a drive over the Golden Gate Bridge to see the magnificent and huge Redwoods in Redwood National Forest.
