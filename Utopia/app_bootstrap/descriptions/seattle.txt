This beautiful, bustling city located on the Puget Sound is full of fun and exciting events and sights to experience. Go to the top of the Space Needle to catch a panoramic view of the whole city and various mountain ranges out in the distance, or grab some coffee on a chilly day and enjoy walking around one of Seattleâ€™s many lovely parks, or stroll around the Pike Place market to see the fisherman throwing fish back and forth.
