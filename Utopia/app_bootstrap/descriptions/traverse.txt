Traverse City is a quaint town with an emerging culture; lovely, little parks are scattered throughout town, and miles of beautiful sand dunes hug the shoreline. Swimming, sailing, paddling, hiking and fishing are favorite warm weather activities, while winter turns the region into a playground for skiers, snowmobilers and snowshoers.
